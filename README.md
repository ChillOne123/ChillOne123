# About me
Hi there! 👋
I am a Social Science Researcher venturing into the world of Computer Science. My passion lies in bridging the gap between domain expertise in public policy and the power of computational methods. I believe that the most compelling stories in modern social science are hidden within massive datasets, waiting to be uncovered by algorithms.
- 🔭 I’m currently working on Applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Causal Inference methods to decode the logic of sustainable development and governance transitions. I am trying to quantify abstract political concepts to understand how policies evolve in response to environmental challenges.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Deepening my understanding of Computer Science fundamentals (Algorithms & Data Structures) to build more robust research pipelines. I am also exploring how Large Language Models (LLMs) can be integrated into traditional econometric frameworks.
- ⌨️ I’m looking to collaborate on Interdisciplinary research projects that sit at the intersection of Environmental Politics, Public Administration, and Computational Social Science (CSS). I am eager to work with anyone interested in "AI for Social Good."
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with Best practices for Software Engineering in Academic Research. As I transition from writing scripts to building projects, I am constantly seeking ways to improve code reproducibility and project management.
- 💬 China's Green Transition, Digital Governance, or why I think every social scientist should learn to use the command line. I love discussing how to operationalize complex social theories into computable variables.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I started my journey purely in the Liberal Arts, but now I spend half my day debugging Python code. I believe the future of policy research is written in both prose and code.
